using IFTTT make an applet from do button to particle https://ifttt.com/create/if-button-press-then-call-a-function to call a function.

Connect to your particle and then connect to ToggleFire and save.

Install Do Button on Android and load widget to desktop and choose the correct function.

takes me about 7 seconds to fire from my smart watch.
